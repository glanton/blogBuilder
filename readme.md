# blogBuilder
Simple Python 3 script that takes the XML export from a WordPress blog and converts it into a CSV file ready to be imported to the Blog content type in OpenScholar

Depending on the version of WordPress used, may require tweaking of the fields (for example, "\{http://wordpress.org/export/1.2/\}post_name") to reflect the correct version number.
